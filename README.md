# Games

This repository contains a collection of all the game support extensions for Vortex.

Most of these extensions are fairly simple as they only add the most basic functionality for a game
to Vortex, that is: allowing the game to be discovered and basic mod management (downloading,
installing, enabling/disabling)
Functionality that goes beyond that (lets say support for save game formats) are implemented in
separate extensions that may also have code specific to certain games, e.g. there is one plugin to
implement the save game support for various gamebryo-based games although each game has a slightly
different format.
